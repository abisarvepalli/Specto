We enrolled and verified the identity of individuals by inserting Kairos's open-source Rest API by converting images into a base64 string and posting them to kairos's server, where an algorithm deconstructs the face using facial geometry. Then, when another image is used to verify the identity, the algorithms uses a standard deviation as means for comparison and returns a confidence level. If the confidence is within a specific range below 90%, we then re-enroll the new image to ensure the algorithm is dynamic. We used HTML/CSS to create the user interface.
